# Overview

Manage your ecommerce stores using the **API V3 endpoints** for lists. You can create, delete, and update stores, as well as configure independent schedules for each one.

# Components

- **Get stores by brand (GET)**
This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of stores associated with a specific brand. It is useful for getting an overview of all operational locations under a brand.

- **Create Stores and Sales Channels (POST)**
This endpoint is used to add new stores and sales channels to the system. It facilitates the efficient expansion and updating of the store network.

- **Get store by ID (GET)**
Allows you to retrieve specific details of a store based on its unique identifier. It is essential for the management and updating of precise information for each individual store.

- **Change store status (PUT**
With this endpoint, you can modify the operational status of a store (e.g., active or inactive). It is crucial for keeping the store's availability up-to-date in real-time.

# FAQ

**If I send a synchronization and have new changes, is it necessary to perform a full store synchronization or just a menu synchronization?**

To reflect the new changes, it is sufficient to send a menu synchronization if the adjustments only affect the menu items. However, if the changes also include modifications to the stores (such as hours, locations, etc.), then a full store synchronization will be required.
