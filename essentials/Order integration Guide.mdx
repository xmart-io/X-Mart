## Overview
Use the Orders API to ingest and manage incoming orders from X-Mart. The API includes a webhook for real-time notifications of new orders.
Once you have correctly configured your webhook URL and menu, you can retrieve and accept orders using the endpoints provided in the Orders API.

### Understanding the Order Flow
To successfully integrate orders, it is essential to follow the X-Mart order integration flow shown in the diagram below.
Study the diagram carefully and ensure you understand each step before proceeding. This will ensure proper implementation and functionality of your integration.

### Order Notifications
The Orders API sends notifications to the webhook configured in your account whenever an order is placed. These notifications provide real-time updates for order ingestion.
Key points to remember:
	•	Your service (a single webhook URL) can receive webhooks for orders across multiple stores.
	•	Ensure your webhook is capable of processing these notifications efficiently to avoid delays or errors.
